Lab 3: Pendant - PWM

This lab uses the Pendant of LEDs from Lab 2. In Lab 3, LED3 and LED7 are programmed to change their intensities by using PWM and changing their duty cycles. The duty cycles of LED3 and LED7 change from 0 to 100% and back to 0% in 5% steps each time the WDT interrupts. They intensities change in opposite directions, one becoming brighter and one becoming dimmer.
