Lab 2: Pendant of LEDs - Timer Interrupts
The goal of this lab is to program a pendant of 8 LEDs arranged in a circle (as detailed in the board and schematic files) so that only 1 LED is lit at any one moment, which LED is lit changes every 333 ms, and the sequence of LEDs lit follows the clockwise direction for 3 cycles, counterclockwise for 3 cycles, and so on.
