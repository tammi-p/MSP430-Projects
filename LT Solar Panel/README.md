Light-Tracking Solar Panel
This project consists of 2 photodiodes and a solar panel mounted on a servo motor. The amount of light detected by the two photodiodes are compared, which determines the degree and direction in which the servo motor rotates. Thus, we programmed the solar panel to tilt in the direction of greatest light.
